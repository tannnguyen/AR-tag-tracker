# Tag Tracker
Our project plans to build an inexpensive autonomous system that can localize and track a robot in camera's field of view, then we can control the robot to move and perform task based on its location. This is the first part of such project where we used Python and OpenCV to keep detect different tags put on top of the robot. 

Our first solution was to use an arrow to detect shapes and orientation. Our second solution was to use AR tag. We tested AR tag indoor and outside to measure the farthest distance it can detect. Some of the results are shared in [resources](https://github.com/tannnguyen/AR-tag-tracker/tree/master/resources) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOrslpp9YcbLBqv6mOjEyPMytAtdL5nf?usp=sharing). Some of the codes are shared in [code](https://github.com/tannnguyen/AR-tag-tracker/tree/master/code).
